  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Sign in with `velora login` (same account as the desktop app; the CLI
      registers as its own device). Full command reference: `velora --help`.

      Browser takeover and the Background Computer need Playwright, which the
      standalone binary does not carry; those two features degrade gracefully.
      Windows ships x64 (runs on Arm through emulation) — install via Scoop or
      the release's PowerShell installer.
